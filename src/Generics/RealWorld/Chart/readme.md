Chart Example
=================================

This folder contains a chart example.  The ChartBase class is an abstract base
class from which both the MultiChart and Statboard classes inherit.  The Before
folder shows the code before the introduction of generics.  The Support folder
contains a number of interface and class definitions necessary to make the 
code able to compile and test. The Test folder contains unit tests 
demonstrating the chart classes.
