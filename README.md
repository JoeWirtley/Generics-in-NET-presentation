Generics in .NET
========================

This repository contains the slides and related sample code for the Generics in .NET presentation.  The slides can be found [in the slides folder](./slides) and the .NET solution is in [src](./src).

Refer to this [bit.ly bundle]( http://bit.ly/GEN-Tag) for some links to useful MSDN documentation and other resources related to generic types in .NET.

Please contact me if you have any questions or comments about the slides or code. 

For an in-depth treatment of Generics in .NET, please check out the screencast I created for O'Reilly at http://bit.ly/GenericsScreencast.  This is a three hour treatment of generics in .NET which allows for inclusion of more material and in depth review of real world examples.
